<h3 id="-about-me-"><strong>About Me:</strong></h3>
<p>I’ve been passionate about technology from a young age, starting with the Atari 2600. Over time, I developed skills in Basic, Pascal, Perl, and HTML, eventually transitioning to PHP, which I’ve used extensively alongside other technologies as needed. Recently, I’ve focused on Laravel development. My experience spans network setup and installation for company offices and buildings, DevOps, DVD production, event coordination, and VoIP systems. I excel at diagnosing and resolving technical issues, learning new skills quickly, and adapting to new software. I have a strong aptitude for troubleshooting and resolving technical issues as they arise, and I’m highly capable of tackling challenges efficiently, leveraging a broad range of software, hardware, and systems expertise.</p>

<h3 id="-work-experience-"><strong>Work Experience</strong></h3>
<p><strong>EasySeven, Toronto (2022 - Present)</strong><br>As Tech Lead/CTO, I led a team in launching a DNS Management and Monetization platform, along with a Domain Marketplace. The project required handling high traffic and building efficient systems capable of managing millions of domains. Working within the constraints of a startup budget, I implemented creative solutions on AWS to ensure scalability and performance. This allowed the system to quickly adapt to user growth, especially for domainers managing portfolios of millions of domains.</p>
<p><strong>YTZ International, Toronto (2008 - Present)</strong><br>In the absence of an official CTO, I assumed the role at YTZ International, leading the development of scalable systems for affiliate marketing. In 2019, I developed a real-time stats system that enabled the company to respond instantly to the performance of marketing landing pages, optimizing results in real-time. This innovative solution was presented at the AWS Summit in 2023. I also focused on cost-efficient strategies and ensuring the infrastructure could handle high traffic while maintaining top performance, driving the company’s growth through technology.</p>
<p><strong>LostLink.Net, Lisbon, Portugal / Toronto (Owner, 1997 - Present)</strong><br>Under the LostLink name, I launched a record label and produced live shows in Portugal. In addition to the entertainment side, I developed a bulk text messaging service around 2003/2004, which gained clients in Portugal, Angola, and Canada. This early venture into communication services showcased my ability to innovate and deliver solutions across different markets.</p>
<p>Additionally, I provided consulting services to several companies, supporting their technological infrastructure and guiding various projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>OrangePrint, Mississauga (2005 - 2013)</strong><br>I consulted on their infrastructure and technological needs, covering website development and maintenance, VoIP systems, and computer networks.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Property Link Group, Mississauga (2008 - 2011)</strong><br>As a consultant, I supported their technological infrastructure, including website maintenance, VoIP, and network solutions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sequencia 7, Lisbon, Portugal (1999 – 2005)</strong><br>I was responsible for all technological decisions, managing a variety of projects that significantly impacted the multimedia landscape in Portugal. I was instrumental in producing the first-ever DVD in Portugal and developed nearly 90% of the Enhanced Audio CDs (ECD) and music-related DVDs for several prominent record labels. I also created cutting-edge web solutions for record labels and artists in Portugal and Cape Verde, ensuring their online presence was modern and effective. My role included server maintenance, email marketing, and comprehensive website development.</p>
