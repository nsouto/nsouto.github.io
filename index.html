            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">About me</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                I’ve been passionate about technology from a young age, starting with the Atari 2600. Over time, I developed skills
                in Basic, Pascal, Perl, and HTML, eventually transitioning to PHP, which I’ve used extensively alongside other
                technologies as needed. Recently, I’ve focused on Laravel development. My experience spans network setup and
                installation for company offices and buildings, DevOps, DVD production, event coordination, and VoIP systems. I
                excel at diagnosing and resolving technical issues, learning new skills quickly, and adapting to new software. I
                have a strong aptitude for troubleshooting and resolving technical issues as they arise, and I’m highly capable of
                tackling challenges efficiently, leveraging a broad range of software, hardware, and systems expertise.

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                I specialize in software development for the web, with a primary focus on PHP and the Laravel ecosystem. My expertise
                also extends into DevOps, where I have hands-on experience with tools like Ansible, AWS, and other cloud platforms.
                I’m proficient in using Terraform for infrastructure as code and building serverless architectures. I have a strong
                background in creating scalable systems optimized for performance and cost, especially in handling high-traffic
                environments. Additionally, I have worked on email marketing campaigns and developed text messaging applications,
                ensuring reliable and efficient communication solutions.

                    As Tech Lead/CTO, I led a team in launching a DNS Management
                    and Monetization platform, along with a Domain Marketplace. The project required handling high traffic and building
                    efficient systems capable of managing millions of domains. Working within the constraints of a startup budget, I
                    implemented creative solutions on AWS to ensure scalability and performance. This allowed the system to quickly
                    adapt to user growth, especially for domainers managing portfolios of millions of domains.

                    In the absence of an official CTO, I assumed the role
                    at YTZ International, leading the development of scalable systems for affiliate marketing. In 2019, I developed a
                    real-time stats system that enabled the company to respond instantly to the performance of marketing landing pages,
                    optimizing results in real-time. This innovative solution was presented at the AWS Summit in 2023. I also focused on
                    cost-efficient strategies and ensuring the infrastructure could handle high traffic while maintaining top
                    performance, driving the company’s growth through technology.
